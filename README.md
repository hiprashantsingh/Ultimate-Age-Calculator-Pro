<h2>💻 Tech Stack Used:</h2>

🚀 Presenting my latest project – Ultimate Age Calculator Pro, a modern and interactive web tool that calculates far more than just your age.

Built with clean HTML, elegant CSS, and powerful JavaScript logic, this age calculator offers a detailed breakdown of your life's journey — with features that combine data, science, and astrology.

🎯 This is not your ordinary age calculator. Instead, it delivers deep insights based on your birth date, showing:

🔢 Chronological Age & Biological Age Estimation

⏳ Life Progress Bar – showing percentage of life completed (based on an average lifespan)

📊 Time Units Tracker – total seconds, minutes, days, and weeks you've lived

🎓 Milestone Analysis – compare your age with average milestones like graduation, marriage, and even reaching 100!

♈ Astrology Section – Zodiac sign, Chinese zodiac, birthstone, life path number

🔬 Scientific Perspective – World population at birth, Earth revolutions, and estimated cell regeneration count

🖨️ Print & Share Buttons – Easily generate a sharable or printable age report

💡 This project showcases how life is not just counted in years, but in moments, milestones, signs, and science. The goal was to create something useful, insightful, and also fun — especially for users curious about their life journey in a data-driven way.

💻 The app is fully responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile, and handles user interactions smoothly with tabs and dynamic updates. All calculations are done in real-time using vanilla JavaScript and Web APIs.
